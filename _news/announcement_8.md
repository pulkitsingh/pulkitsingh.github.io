As my second year of graduate school comes to an end, I am excited to announce that I have been awarded a fellowship through [The Training Program in Theory and Computation for Next Generation Neuroscientists (TPCN)](https://neuroscience.uchicago.edu/training-program-theory-and-computation-next-generation-neuroscientists) for my third year. So grateful to be part of this vibrant research community, I'm learning a lot!
