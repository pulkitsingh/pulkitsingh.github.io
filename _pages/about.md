I am a PhD student in the Computational Neuroscience program at The University of Chicago, advised by [David Freedman](https://monkeylogic.uchicago.edu/). I am interested in vision and decision making, and work on computational modeling of non-human primate categorization experiments. In addition, I develop biologically-inspired machine learning methods.

Previously, I was an ML Engineer at the [Machine Learning for Health](https://www.broadinstitute.org/ml4h) team at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Whilst there, I co-created a natural language processing pipeline for cerebrovascular disease identification, and trained computer vision models to predict disease risk and classify subgroups. Prior to this, I graduated with honors from Princeton University, with a BA in Computer Science. My undergraduate thesis, advised by [Tom Griffiths](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/index.php), explored cognitively-inspired constraints on neural networks performing categorization.

I am passionate about community organization and scientific equity, more info here. In my free time, I enjoy knitting, wheel throwing ceramics, reading cozy mystery books, biking, and going on walks to find new favorite trees.
